Description: 
    This package aims to be a light-weight alternative to the widely 
    used network analysis package "igraph" in calculating standardized 
    centrality measures from the adjacency matrix. The benefit of 
    thispackage is that it circumvents the excessive steps of 
    converting the adjacency matrix into a graph, etc., since that 
    information is not necessary for centrality measure computation 
    and would simply be a waste of computational resources in this context. 
    The drawback of this package is that the functionality is not as 
    complete as that of the package `igraph`, with certain inherent 
    assumptions such as no self-loops exist. It is also only capable 
    of calculating degree and closeness centrality measures.
